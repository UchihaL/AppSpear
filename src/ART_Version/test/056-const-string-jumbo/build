# Write out files with 32768 total static string declarations, so that
# the reference to "zorch" in the real test file will be guaranteed to
# need a jumbo string reference (it sorts last after all the others).
# Note: Each string reference is stored in a separate static variable,
# and that variable's name is also represented in the strings, which
# is why we can just have 32768 and not 65536 declarations.
