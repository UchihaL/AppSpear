This is more a benchmark for the verifier than a real test. We create many
classes, each one initializing a big array of string in its class initializer.
This generates big <clinit> methods in these classes. The goal is to stress the
verifier on such method.

Note: these classes are generated automatically. The number of classes and the
size of string array can be modified in the script.
