ClassLoader.loadClass() is expected to throw an exception, usually
ClassNotFound, if it can't find the given Class, and not return null.

This is a regression test for a defect in Dalvik, which was assuming
that if there was no exception, the value returned would be non-null.

This test is not expected to work for the reference implementation.
