This test causes a linkage error, which calls dvmFreeClassInnards on
the unlinked Class.

This is a regression test for a defect in Dalvik, which was assuming
that dvmFreeClassInnards could be called twice on the same class.

This test is a modified version of test 086.
This test is not expected to work for the reference implementation.
