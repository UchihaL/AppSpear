This is a test case to ensure proper preservation of local variable information through the register renamer and dead code remover at the beginning of the SSA conversion.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
