This is a dump of a simple class which is valid in structure but is overall
invalid. That being said, the system should still have no trouble parsing and
dumping it.

The salient bit of parsing tested here is that the constant pool contains
at least one valid entry of each possible constant pool type, and that
entries that are referred to by other entries always occur before the
referring entries.
