This is a dump of a simple class which is valid in structure but is overall
invalid. That being said, the system should still have no trouble parsing and
dumping it.

The salient bit of parsing tested here is that the class has a single
class-level InnerClasses attribute, which is syntactically valid and contains
one entry for each of the possible combinations of null-vs-valid cpe.
