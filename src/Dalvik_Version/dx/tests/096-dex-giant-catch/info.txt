This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which checks to see that
very long catch ranges (that cover >= 65536 code units) get emitted
appropriately.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
