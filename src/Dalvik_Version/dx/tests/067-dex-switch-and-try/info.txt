This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which looks at a couple cases of
embedding a switch statement in a try-catch and vice versa. This test
was created specifically because of a bug with exactly this situation.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
