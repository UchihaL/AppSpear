This is a smoke test of a couple cases of minimal dex creation:

The first test tries to create the truly minimal dex file by using the
--no-files option. The output dump of this is checked to make sure it
is exactly correct. (There is arguably only one "right" answer.)

The second test tries to convert a minimal classfile and ensures that
the conversion runs without failure, though the contents of the
converted file are not checked for correctness.
