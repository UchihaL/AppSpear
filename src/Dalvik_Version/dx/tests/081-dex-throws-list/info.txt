This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which checks to make sure that
throws lists (that is, list of declared exceptions on methods) get
represented reasonably.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
