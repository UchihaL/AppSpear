This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which makes sure that a couple
cases of (potentially) infinite loops translate reasonably.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
