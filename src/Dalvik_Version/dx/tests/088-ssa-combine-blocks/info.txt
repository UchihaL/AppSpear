This is a test case for the identical-block combining algorithm, which runs after the SSA optimizer to recombine identical blocks (usually exception handlers) created during edge-splitting.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
