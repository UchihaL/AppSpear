This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which checks to make sure that
local variable tables stay in sync when the register set gets renumbered
to make room for low scratch registers.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
