This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which checks to make sure that
exception handler tables get built reasonably (combining entries that
ought to be combined, listing entries in a correct and sensible order,
etc.).

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
