This tests various aspects of the SCCP pass for correctness, and to
ensure there aren't any regressions.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
